proj-template-angular-vs
=======

A simple template for starting angular projects in visual studio. Just took angular-seed and wiggled it in. Have to use a web project as nothing works right in vs if added to a solution. Needs to be in a project. Named the project "app" so maintain an app and test folder structure and kept the same angular-seed structure, which makes sense to me for updates.
